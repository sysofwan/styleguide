styleguide
=================

Coding style guide, recommendation, and design patterns, based on my experince. This guide is based on my experince reading and writing hard to read and modify (read: bad) code--code that was written without caring/thinking about its design, and my frustrations with it. It is also based on my experience reading and trying to write better code--code that is easy to read, modify, and add features.

I will (hopefully) continually update this guide with languages/frameworks as I gain more experience.

Disclaimers:

1. This guide is solely based on my experience, and is not representative of community guidelines.
2. This guide was written before leaving my current workplace ISD, U of Michigan. Most of what is written is based on my experience working here.
